# The (Hunter) Hawks' Highway

## Inspiration
Hawks' Highway is an Eco-friendly travel planner, inspired by the need to address carbon emissions and promoting sustainable travel habits. It is designed for every day commuters and offers a gamified approach to reducing carbon emissions.

## About us
We are a team of 4 students from Hunter college, first or second time attending a hackathon event. We live traveling, and we have a passion for sustainability. We are excited to bring this project to life. Features are still very limited, due to time constraints.

## Purpose
This project aims to:
- Track and gamify sustainable actions, specifically carbon footprint reduction from regular commutes
- Foster community engagement in eco-friendly practices
- Provide insights into personal environmental impact
